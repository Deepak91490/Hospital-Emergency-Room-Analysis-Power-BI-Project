# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis-Power-BI-Project
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to **analyze emergency room patient data** to uncover operational insights that can help improve **patient flow, satisfaction, and resource management**. The project aims to:

- Identify operational bottlenecks affecting patient experience.
- Highlight periods of high patient volume to optimize staffing.
- Understand patient demographics and referral patterns.
- Provide actionable recommendations for improving emergency care delivery.

## Key Insights

- **9,216 unique patients** recorded over 19 months.
- **Average wait time:** 35.3 minutes.
- **Average satisfaction score:** 4.99/10.
- Majority referrals to **General Practice** and **Orthopedics**.
- Peak busy days: **Saturday, Thursday, and Sunday**.
- Busiest hours: **7 AM, 11 AM, 1 PM, and 11 PM**.
- Diverse race distribution with a large proportion of patients declining to disclose.
- Nearly equal split between **admitted** and **treated & released** patients.

## Process
**The project followed a structured, step-by-step approach**:
- **Data Collection**: Imported emergency room patient data for a 19-month period.
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Removed duplicates, handled null values, and formatted data for analysis.
- **Data Modeling**: Structured the data model in Power BI, establishing necessary relationships.
- **KPI Calculation**: Created calculated measures using DAX for key metrics like average wait time, satisfaction score, and patient counts.
- **Dashboard Development**: Designed interactive visuals including KPI cards, charts, heat maps, and tables.
- **Insight Extraction**: Analyzed trends and patterns to identify operational issues, patient demographics, and peak periods.
- **Reporting**: Finalized an interactive dashboard and summarized key findings and recommendations.

## Conclusion
This analysis of the emergency room dataset, spanning April 2023 to October 2024, provides valuable insights into patient flow, satisfaction, and operational patterns. The findings highlight areas of strength, such as effective referral pathways to General Practice and Orthopedics, as well as opportunities for improvement, particularly in patient wait times and satisfaction levels. Notably, peak periods during weekends and specific hours demand strategic staffing adjustments to better manage patient volumes and enhance service delivery.
The demographic breakdown reveals a diverse patient population with varied healthcare needs, emphasizing the importance of culturally sensitive and inclusive care practices. Additionally, the nearly balanced admission and discharge rates suggest the emergency room functions both as a critical point of care and a triage hub for broader hospital services.
Overall, these insights provide a solid foundation for hospital administrators to make data-driven decisions aimed at improving patient experiences, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing overall emergency room efficiency.
